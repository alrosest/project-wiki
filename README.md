project-wiki
============

Lawrence Creates project wiki. 

This will wikify the Lawrence Creates Project Form :

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eDmABD9gnlc0PdPw7Nu93BRmgqmUlp0_9CKFxs58EKs/edit#

The responses will be stored in a data.csv file and converted to a wiki format. 

The template is templates/project.tpl, it currently emits markdown.
The data is read and the templates are applied and output is written into project.

Use python project.py to run it.
